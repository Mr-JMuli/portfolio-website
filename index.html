    <p class="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      I am an IT Officer with a BSc in Computer Science, dedicated to keeping technology running smoothly and securely. My expertise spans network administration, email systems, security policy development, and CCTV management. I provide user support and coordinate with vendors for seamless IT equipment procurement, configuration, and maintenance. Through continuous monitoring and evaluation, I ensure our systems are robust, efficient, and aligned with organizational goals. I take pride in a proactive, solution-oriented approach and clear communication with teams and stakeholders.

      I am passionate about exploring cloud computing, cybersecurity (especially blue team defense), Linux, and web development. I thrive on solving complex problems and leveraging emerging technologies to drive innovation and secure results.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      This drive has guided my professional growth. I earned the Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate (KCNA) certification and I'm currently pursuing ISC2's Certified in Cybersecurity (CC) and the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner credentials. I am also studying for Microsoft's SC-900 (Security, Compliance, and Identity Fundamentals) and an IBM SkillsBuild Cybersecurity certificate. My academic background (BSc) and multiple verified Credly badges further reflect my commitment to continuous learning and adapting to the ever-evolving tech landscape.

      Looking ahead, I am excited to leverage my experience and skills to build resilient, innovative IT solutions. By combining hands-on expertise with a passion for emerging technology, I'm confident in driving growth and security for any forward-thinking team. Let's connect and see what we can achieve together!
