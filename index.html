Hi, I’m John Muli, a solutions-oriented ICT professional with over 6 years of experience in network administration, cloud computing (AWS), cybersecurity, and IT support. I thrive on building technology solutions that improve efficiency, reduce costs, and strengthen business operations.

Throughout my career, I’ve delivered measurable impact, including:

Reducing downtime by 30% through proactive network administration and infrastructure optimization.

Cutting email-related issues by 90% by successfully administering and streamlining Microsoft 365.

Designing and deploying cloud-native tools with Python, Flask, and AWS to automate backups, ensure data redundancy, and boost productivity.

I’m passionate about cloud technologies, Linux, cybersecurity, and modern web development. Beyond my professional roles, I continuously learn and work on innovative projects that bridge efficiency, security, and scalability.

My long-term goal is to become an ICT expert who empowers organizations to thrive through reliable, scalable, and secure technology solutions. When I’m not solving ICT challenges, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies, contributing to projects, and exploring creative ways to push systems to their best performance.
